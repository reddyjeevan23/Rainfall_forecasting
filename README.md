# Rainfall_forecasting_R

## Data Sources:
In order to predict the rain, the base dataset containing daily weather observations from numerous Australian weather stations are collected, which was created from the source available from http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/data.
We pulled out this dataset from Kaggle for our analysis purpose which can be accessed using following link https://www.kaggle.com/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package. 
The data gathered comprises more than a decade of measurements taken in real time and on reading the dataset for few samples, we observed that the data needs cleaning as it contains redundant data.
